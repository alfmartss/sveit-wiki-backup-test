<h1><strong>A Tower On The Horizon</strong></h1>
<p>Fate? It must have been one of these 'fateful days' when all of a sudden, a man with an unhealthy greenish skin and a long flowing beard appeared in the village's drinking hall, demanding to know how the warriors had bested Eikthyr. As it turned out, the strange man was <a href="/roleplay/characters/Ragnulf-the-Hunter">Ragnulf the Hunter</a> himself, who - as he put it - was sent from Valhalla by Ullr and Odin to see "who those chaps are that killed the King of the Hunt". A moment that caused confusion and unease among the listeners in the hall.</p>

<p>Ragnulf explained further that after he and his men could not beat Eikthyr themselves, his men got upset with the island and wanted to sail forth in search for pillage and plunder. That was when they sailed east to another island on which they then built an outpost. It turned out Ragnulf was quite the talker and so he spoke to the warriors about a strange, foreign merchant offering his men a treasure if they assisted him in finding it. Funny, why did the merchant make that offer? Traders weren't known for their willingness to part with coin and gold?</p>
<p>As the warriors pressed Ragnulf for more, he told them that for whatever reason, the search for the treasure made his men "bad" and greedy. Well, after all they were all raiders, weren't they? Somehow, Ragnulf seemed pleased to have been killed during a Greydwarf attack and brought to Valhalla by the Valkyries for drinking and carousing and "having a good one", while his men all went mad ...or worse.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Ragnulf thanked the warriors for their work, asked back his knife from his grave and bade them all farewell ...until next time.</p>
