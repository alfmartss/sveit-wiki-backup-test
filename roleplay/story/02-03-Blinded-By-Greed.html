<p>After having established their small outpost on the ruins what revealed itself as "Isengrim's Tower" the warriors began to scout the island in search for clues to what Ragnulf had told them. Not long, and they discovered a peculiar cave along the eastern shore. It was somewhat fortified and inside there was a small but abandoned camp. All seemed to be in disorder but on the wall and above a chest they found troubling scratchings: <i>"Should never have taken his gold".</i></p>
<p>Troubling as it sounded, it was just the beginning. There was another cave - "Isengrim's Den" - where they found more traces of people - outcasts maybe - who claimed they had succumbed to a curse by taking gold from ...someone? The warriors were reminded of Ragnulf's words of warning regarding a foreign merchant wanting to find a treasure together with his crew. Could that be the missing link?</p>
<p>The chest in Isengrim's Den was loaded with some coin, along with various other items a seafarer and warrior might have in his stash. However, after debating the curse and its possible implications the warriors decided to leave all as it was and take (almost) nothing from the hoard. Instead, they decided to explore the island more and see where that curse came from and who this "HIS" might be.</p>
