<h1><strong>The Jarl's Banquet</strong></h1>
<p>When the Jarl finally called for banquet, the warriors also brought the gifts with them and offered them to the Gods in a ceremony: the tasty mead, four Surtling cores and also Ragnulf’s Knife. When Skúld arrived she also gave the warriors a fair glimpse into a possible future:&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>“Ah yes, mead is not only the lifeblood of the warrior. It is the Gods’ lifeblood also, for they are as mortal as you are. By drinking it they are reminded of the sweetness of life and the absence of Godly burdens, if only for a short time. Did you not know that? The Gods envy you for “life”, even in Valheim. They will perish when Ragnarök finally comes and the whole world is drowned. It is inevitable, for it is weaved into the tapestry of fate. And they know.”</i></p>
<p><i>“Now to Surtur, the Fiery One. He guards the realm of Múspellheim, the land of fire. He is of the Jötnar, who hate the Gods. When Ragnarök comes, he will battle Frey and bring fire unto the lands until they are all washed away by the deep waters. His minions are spirits of the burning rock. You will meet them in time, have no doubt. Their essence is the fiery rock from which their abode is made. These cores are a means to tap into Godly power, if only for a small time. There is great power in the place within, if these cores are lit in a circle.”</i></p>
<p><i>“And now the knife of the hunter. Copper is the magic metal that ensnares foes and binds their power. Ragnulf knew this when he tried to vanquish Eikthyr, the King of Deer. So he had this knife made by Alfward, the smith. One of you will use it."</i></p>
<p><i>“You have done well, although your peril is far from over. To prepare for the Allfather’s mighty enemies, you need to summon and slay <strong>Glófnir, the King of Boars</strong>. He still roams the lands of Álfheim. But you will force him here. In time, you will know how.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>“Take this ancient bark from the siblings of Yggdrasil, the tree that holds the worlds together. Guard it well and waste it not, for you shall need it. Until then, steel your minds and bodies. Run like the boar and jump like the deer. Be resourceful and know the land. Once summoned, Glófnir will not tire until either you perish or he is beaten.”</i></p>
