<h1>The Restless</h1>
<p>After the deliberate plunder of a burial ship of the Honored Dead, ghosts started to roam the lands, destroying farms, crops and harassing the roads. Only through communal effort, the spells of a sei√∞rman and the soothing lullaby in the Ancient Tongue could they be put at rest again.</p>
