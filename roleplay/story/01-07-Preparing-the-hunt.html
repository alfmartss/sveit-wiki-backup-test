<h1>Preparing The Hunt</h1>
<p>On this day, Skúld appeared to the warriors and guided them towards preparing the village's stone circle for the <strong>summoning of Glófnir</strong>. The first step was the preparation of the summoning circle adequately for a truly wild hunt:</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;“This shall be the place where the calling will take place. We will call Glófnir from the meadows of Alfheim into this circle of stones. For the hunters the entry is marked with a path and the gaps between the stones need closing. You will raise four great fires with the ancient wood I gave you and bind the stones with wooden beams.”&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>“Also, make this a place of a wild hunt. Fashion it with the bounties of the woods and fields, and Glófnir will be startled by your huntsman skills. You have this day and the morrow. On Thor’s Day, when Sól sinks over the waters, you will call him and slay him. For the calling, bring as many ancient seeds as can be found, for Glófnir loves to devour them.”</i></p>
<p><i>“For the hunt, fight like the hunter: Not clad in heavy armor and armed with metal, but with leather, flint and stone. If you do this deed, the Allfather and Ullr will surely smile on you; and fate maybe, too.”</i></p>
