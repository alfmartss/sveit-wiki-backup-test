<p><br>Days had passed and the warriors had searched the island quite thoroughly. Although they didn't find any more caves that were inhabited by anything else than trolls, they eventually discovered a half sunken chest beneath what must have been a burial dolmen. Again, they found ancient scratchings on one of the stones reading: "Rag' ye honorable - Take 'em coins back!"<br>Well, if that wasn't something! But there was more: Scratchings on other dolmens continued to moan about a trickster who seemingly had betrayed those he had dealt with.</p>
<p>The search for more clues culminated in an ancient burial chamber that was literally infested with all kinds of rotten, walking corpses. Inside the warriors found a number of sacrificial altars with loot and plunder on them, all in a vain attempts to please whatever Gods these draugr had prayed to long ago. At the end of the day, there were only the obscure "Rag' the Honorable" or a scheming trickster or merchant. When the warriors discussed, Skúld the Norn chose to appear, saying that 'there is always one trickster above all others' and that 'he comes here from time to time' - whatever that meant.</p>
<p>Again, the warriors decided against taking anything from the hoard for themselves but instead wanted to collect all cursed gold they could possibly find and then do ...something. What choices did they have?</p>
<p>Well, you always have choices and Skúld again reminded them that both the island and the warriors' paths were full of them...</p>
