<p>The warriors met an old man at the place of a ritual, sitting on a rock and sleeping. It seemed he was hard to wake, a warrior slapped the old man so he would wake up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the old man woke up he only spoke an old and ancient tongue that no other than Thyra could speak. Her parents teached her this language with the words “One day you will have to speak to the old ones”.</p>
<p>The old man talked about a sword that was taken and to be found in a place where there is no dead tho no one eats. For a long time the people searched for something that would never eat nor would die.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By searching a nearby crypt and fighting a lot of undead they finally found a sword with a name written in old runes on it. “Fafnir” was the name on the sword, maybe the name of the old man?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The old man was gone and so had the warriors to wait till the day he sat on his rock and slept all alone. Again the warriors woke him up and talked to him. He answered what was asked in the old tongue and said nothing else as he had to. As the men asked what this place is he answered “The place of the big tree, the place of sacrifice and life” so they asked what is the big tree and he said “The guardian of the dark forest”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The men did not want to wait so they took some seeds the old man had given them and burned them in a fire on the place of sacrifice.</p>
<p>They had summoned a tree that was bigger as any troll they had seen with purple glowing eyes and a scream as loud that Odin could hear it in Valhalla.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The men held their line, prepared their weapons and got ready for a big fight. The Tree looked at the small warriors with its glowing eyes, his skin was made out of roots moving around and winding together to make it hard to hit his heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He summoned roots out of the ground to hit the warriors further away from him and he stomped the ground to kill the ones close enough. He could shoot with vines like arrows at one with several vines at one time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fight was hard and it took time to kill him, but the warriors were prepared and remembered what “Gridr” wrote down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“But when you have burned the big tree…” and so it was, the arrows were prepared with resin to set that monster on fire.</p>
<p>While fighting the old man was gone, he had sailed off with a boat and was not seen anymore. But <a href="/roleplay/characters/Jarl-Njal">Njal</a> appeared at the sacrificial area with new clothes and a serious message. He was wearing a strong armour with a white wolf around his neck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His words were <i>“Odin has sent me back to my Hall, I shall guard you and lead you to the islands, help you with questions if you need me. But from now on you have to show Odin you are capable to fight without me. The Bluecloaks will be under my straight order and will lead the warriors into dungeons, new islands and will do as I command. You will now have to prove Odin you are worthy to be here and show him you are strong. You shall give Odin Sacrifices in form of weapons, armours and other specialties he may like. If not, Odin will punish the warriors that are weak and not showing their strength good enough.But I shall still be on your side and help you if you need me with words of wisdom. Be smart enough to ask me the right questions but never ask me to fight with you. Oh and by the way, I still want my mead every now and then, make sure it tastes good”</i></p>
<p>Now it is time to show that the warriors will be able to fight alone and without the help of Njal.</p>
