<h1>Down With The King</h1>
<p>While the threat of the constant Greydwarf attacks increased steadily elsewhere, the warriors of Valheim prepared for the final hunting down of Glófnir, the King of Boars. They had hung nearly a hundred trophies on the stones of the circle and laid out the ground with the hides of slain deer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, Skúld told them to assemble before the portal to Alfheim and to don their leather and flint. When all seemed ready, the Norn opened the gate to the meadows of the realm of the elves. And Glófnir and his army answered the call. Soon the summoning ground was swarming with wild boars - and not few managed to break the stone circle's magical barricades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, the hunters persisted and broke wave after wave, when finally, the mighty King of Boars himself tried to charge them down. But it was a vain attempt, for the power of the hunt's items in the circle made him weak to the weapons of the hunters. And so he was brought down with might, wit and cunning. At the hands of the warriors of Valheim, Glófnir perished and the way was now free to move to the Allfather's first major enemy: Eikthyr, King of the Hunt.</p>
