<h1>Gridr the lost warrior</h1>
<p>After the message from Odin that a warrior called "Gridr" was send to our island with a message for Njal, we went out to find the last known location of "Gridr". It was told that the Warrior was given a ship to land on this island but without any coordinates of our village.</p>
<p>After searching the west our brave warriors found a little house with runes written on the walls saying "Danger" or "I have to tell Njal". Little did we know what was behind this situation. One message said "Meet me in the mountains" and we know that this island has only got one mountain.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>On our way we met a lot of trolls working with greydwarfs and skeletons in armys that where trying to stop us from finding the truth. As we reached the mountains we found a little hut with a campfire outside next to the entrance. The hut also had runes on the walls saying "I can not wait, meet me on the island north-east".</p>
<p>Due to nighttime we decided to stay at the fireplace and listen to the story's of foreign lands that Erland had adventured in his life before. A story about trees with not drinkable water inside it and a land made of sand without any space for crops or animals. And a land far in the east with weird people and very weird ways to live.</p>
<p>As it became day we moved on, we found a island full with very strong greydwarfs and portals in the stones. I am afraid the greydwarfs have learned to fight, group up and build things. What shall come next? They already group with trolls and fight in armies.</p>
<p>Odin knew nothing, but the test has began. It is time to show that we are more then lost souls and show them what we are able to do.</p>
<p>To our strong warriors that helped us today!</p>
