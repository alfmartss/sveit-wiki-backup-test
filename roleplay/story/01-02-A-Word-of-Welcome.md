# A Word Of Welcome
So on this day, [Skúld the Norn](/roleplay/characters/Skuld) spoke to the assembled warriors in cryptic words:

“I am one of the Three. Gods and men come to me and seek my counsel. They ask of ages past and of what is to come. And I tell them, but nothing is without cost. I am Skúld and I can help you. But it will cost you. What, I will not tell, because the spinners of fate have not yet wrought your threads. But you will know in time.”

“The Gods are wayward, and not all are kind towards you. Whatever they give, they always want something in return. Whenever they smile upon you, they also hide a grudge.”

“Such is the way with Gods. And the Gods made you as their images so they are reminded how futile their squabbles are. And squabbles you shall have, strife and great battles. For this is why you were brought here. You are on an errand you cannot escape: To kill the enemies of the Allfather.”

“I will give you a taste of what awaits: Bring me skins of tasty mead, which the Gods hold dear, the copper knife of Ragnulf the Hunter and four fiery cores of Múspell’s minions when the Jarl calls for banquet. Then we shall see what the threads of fate hold for you, humans.”
