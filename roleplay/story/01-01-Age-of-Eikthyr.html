<p>On the second day of landfall, <a href="/roleplay/characters/Jarl-Njal">Jarl Njal</a> assembled his men and ordered them to train in arms and to form strong companionships. Logs needed cutting, ores needed to be mined and there was mead to be keltered in huge fermenters to please the Gods.</p>
<p>Also on that day, <a href="/roleplay/characters/Skuld">Skúld the Norn</a> showed herself to the warriors of Valheim, proclaiming that the Gods are wayward and vain. She spoke of the prowess of the warriors and of skill and of perseverance, and so she asked the Jarl to assemble his followers for the evening the day after.</p>
<p>“There is strife not only in the fields and in the woods, but below and also in the Sky. You need to know and you need to prepare.”</p>
