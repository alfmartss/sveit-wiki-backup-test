<h1 class="toc-header" id="the-knife-of-ragnulf-the-hunter"> The Knife Of Ragnulf The Hunter</h1><div>
</div><p>So the tapestry of fate was spun over the warriors of Vahleim.</p><div>
</div><p>The warriors set out to reconcile over the copper knife and what the Norn had revealed to them:</p><div>
</div><p>“Ragnulf the Hunter was a mighty warrior and slayer of wild beasts. In life, he was also a bold seafarer, as was the rest of his clan. When Ragnulf finally perished, his men laid his body in a stone ship, as was customary among the shore people.”</p><div>
</div><p>After much pain at the hands of the minions of wayward Gods, the warriors met with Skúld on the northern shores of the Isle. There they found the ruins of Ragnaby, the hamlet Ragnulf's men had built, before they faltered and perished. There, they fulfilled their part of a greater bargain; a bargain that would yet have to reveal itself in full. For the time being, though, the smile was with them, for the copper knife was theirs - and victory.</p><div>
</div><p>However, Skúld's final words rang heavy in their hearts: "You have done well - for now."<br>
