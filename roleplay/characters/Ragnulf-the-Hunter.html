<p>“Ragnulf the Hunter was a mighty warrior and slayer of wild beasts. In life, he was also a bold seafarer, as was the rest of his clan. When Ragnulf finally perished, his men laid his body in a stone ship, as was customary among the shore people.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The copper knife of Ragnulf the Hunter” is one of the items Skuld asks for on her first meeting with the townfolk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ragnulf the Hunter had told them that his remaining crew had ventured to an eastward island and established an outpost there.</p>
<p>Eventually they found the outpost Ragnulf's men had built but it was in ruin and under constant siege by the filthy Greydwarfs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The questions now were: What happened to Ragnulf's men&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Afterward, a man with an unhealthy greenish skin and a long flowing beard appeared in the village's drinking hall, demanding to know how the warriors had bested Eikthyr. As it turned out, the strange man was Ragnulf the Hunter himself, who - as he put it - was sent from Valhalla by Ullr and Odin to see "who those chaps are that killed the King of the Hunt".</p>
<p>Ragnulf explained further that after he and his men could not beat Eikthyr themselves, his men got upset with the island and wanted to sail forth in search for pillage and plunder. That was when they sailed east to another island on which they then built an outpost. It turned out Ragnulf was quite the talker and so he spoke to the warriors about a strange, foreign merchant offering his men a treasure if they assisted him in finding it. Funny, why did the merchant make that offer? Traders weren't known for their willingness to part with coin and gold?</p>
<p>As the warriors pressed Ragnulf for more, he told them that for whatever reason, the search for the treasure made his men "bad" and greedy. Well, after all they were all raiders, weren't they? Somehow, Ragnulf seemed pleased to have been killed during a Greydwarf attack and brought to Valhalla by the Valkyries for drinking and carousing and "having a good one", while his men all went mad ...or worse.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Ragnulf thanked the warriors for their work, asked back his knife from his grave and bade them all farewell ...until next time.</p>
