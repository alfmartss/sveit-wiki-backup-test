</div><p>Skúld is one of the three Norns of Norse mythology. On "Sveit RP" she is the Gamemaster figure. As such she gives out quests, triggers events or just keeps watching the warriors (i.e. you). If she is around and doesn't speak, consider her "not there".</p><div>
</div><p>Also, don't be confused: Skúld can reach places that are "off" for mortals; for the time being at least.</p><div>
