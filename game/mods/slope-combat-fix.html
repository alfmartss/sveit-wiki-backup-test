<h1>About this mod</h1>
<p>Are you sick of fighting wolves on slopes and not being able to hit them? This mod uncaps the Y angle of your attacks so you can now look straight down or up and hit things if they are in range. This should've been in the game right off the bat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Comments</h1>
<p>The hitboxfix mod unlocks Y axis for aiming when slashing/stabbing/somehow attacking with a melee weapon other than pickaxe and stagbreaker. You actually attack in the direction you look, including up and down! What that means? <strong>Many people are used to play the game while looking into the ground a few meters in front of them = their characters are looking down</strong> = they will be hitting ground instead of enemies if not close enough.</p>
<p>This mod makes it easier to attack enemies in a hilly area, but you have to keep in mind the look up/down thing!</p>
