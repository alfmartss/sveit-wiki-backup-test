<p>As of version 0.7.8 of EpicLoot there have been a number of changed item traits and also new ones. Some of them are very specialised and others have a more general bonus. In order to understand and judge the “value” of a trait you can find a full list of them here. They are taken from the translations.json file from the EpicLoot plugin folder.</p>
<p>Some of the specific traits depend on the player being at <mark class="pen-red">“critical health”</mark>, meaning it will only trigger if the player's current health drops below 30%. To compensate, such bonuses are bigger than the regular ones.</p>
