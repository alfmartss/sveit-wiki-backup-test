<p>World of Valheim - Server Side Characters gives the server control of the users character file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Server-Side Characters: When a client connects to the server, the server will look and see if it has an existing character file stored for this player.&nbsp; If it does not it will then create a brand new character file for the client.&nbsp; It will then send the character file to the client and ask periodically for updates about that character.&nbsp; If the user leaves the server the character file on the server will be updated, however, the clients character on the client will not.<br>&nbsp;</p>
